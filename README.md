# 🌍 Global Temperature Analysis

Understanding how our planet is changing is crucial. This project analyzes monthly temperature and humidity data over a 10-year span. It highlights patterns and showcases how global temperatures and humidity levels are rising, year by year, through meaningful visualizations.

- 📈 Monthly temperature trends comparison over 10 years  
- 💧 Monthly humidity levels and how they correlate with temperature changes  
- 🧠 Insightful visual patterns using line plots and bar graphs  

## ✨ Features

- Comparative graphs of temperature and humidity month-wise for each year
- Identification of rising trends and patterns in global climate
- Clean, readable plots using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Well-commented code in Jupyter Notebook for learning and experimentation

## 🧰 Tech Stack
